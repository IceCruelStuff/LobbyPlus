## General
LobbyPlus is a new lobby system for pmmp, developed by chhiwe. A detailed description can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/chhiwe/LobbyPlus/wiki">wiki</a>.

Here you can get the <a href="https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/chhiwe/lobbyplus/lobbyplus">.phar</a>


## Warnings
- For using UI on item click, install the plugin <a href='https://github.com/jojoe77777/FormAPI'> FormAPI </a>! (This will be added as libary in future.)
- This plugin was made for Lobby**Servers**. It's not recommended to use it as a per world Lobby, because it's cancelling events on the whole server!


## Errors / Ideas
If there are any errors with our service, or you have any idea for it, please open an issue! Check if you're using FormAPI and if there is already an issue like that, before opening an issue.
